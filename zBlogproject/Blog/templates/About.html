<p>This is a simple blog project when you are a new user than signup and then login 
when you login , dashboard is open and as a user by-defalt you are Author so you have permission to add post  and edit post
but when you become an admin then you have rights to delete post 
and inside this you have permission to change password .


contact page is not working it is just for later use </p>
