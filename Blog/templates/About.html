<p>This is a simple blog project when you are a new user than signup and then login 
when you login , dashboard is open and as a user by-defalt you are Author so you have permission to add post  and edit post
but when you become an admin then you have rights to delete post  when you type in login form as  admin name:sakib and password is jimmy@123 then admin panel is open.
and inside this you have permission to change password but you can't change admin password it is only in my hand i.e creater of this blog...


contact page is not working it is just for later use </p>
